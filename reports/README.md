# Reports Directory

**Purpose**: Stores generated research and analysis reports during Next.js project setup workflows.

**Status**: Gitignored (generated files, not committed)

---

## Contents

This directory contains auto-generated reports from the nextjs-project-setup skill:

### Foundation Research Reports
- `foundation-research.md` - Phase 1 research synthesis
  - Template options summary
  - Component strategy (references global skills)
  - Database setup approach (if applicable)
  - Design system starting point
  - **Target**: 700-1000 tokens
  - **Generated by**: Phase 1 (Foundation Research)

### Report Characteristics
- **Concise**: 700-1000 tokens target
- **Evidence-based**: Cites global skills, MCP queries
- **Structured**: Follows templates from .claude/templates/
- **Timestamped**: Uses YYYYMMDD-HHMM-{type}-{id}.md pattern (future)

---

## Cleanup Strategy

**Retention Policy**:
- Keep last 5 reports per type
- Delete older reports to prevent accumulation
- Automated via cleanup script

**Automated Cleanup** (✅ Created in Phase D):

Script: `reports/cleanup-reports.sh`

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted (dry run)
./reports/cleanup-reports.sh --dry-run

# Perform actual cleanup
./reports/cleanup-reports.sh
```

**What It Does**:
- Finds all timestamp reports by type
- Sorts by modification time (newest first)
- Keeps last 5 of each type
- Deletes older reports
- Supports dry-run mode for safe testing

**Report Types Handled**:
- Foundation research reports
- Design ideator reports
- QA validation reports
- Documentation audit reports
- Generic timestamp reports (catch-all)

**When to Run**:
- Before starting new project setup (clean slate)
- Monthly cleanup (prevent accumulation)
- After major development cycles (housekeeping)

**Manual Cleanup** (if needed):
```bash
# List all reports by age
ls -lt reports/

# Remove specific report
rm reports/[report-name].md
```

## Usage

**During Project Setup**:
1. Phase 1 generates `foundation-research.md`
2. Subsequent phases read from this report
3. Report provides context without re-querying

**Token Efficiency**:
- OLD: 4 agents × 2000 tokens = 8,000 tokens
- NEW: Global skills (500t) + MCP (300t) + synthesis (700t) = 1,500 tokens
- **Savings**: 6,500 tokens (81% reduction)

**Progressive Disclosure**:
- Report stored here
- Referenced by name in Phase 2+ (e.g., @reports/foundation-research.md)
- Loaded only when needed

---

## Notes

- Reports are **generated artifacts**, not source files
- Always safe to delete (regenerated on next run)
- Gitignored to keep repository clean
- Use CoD^Σ notation in reports for evidence tracing
